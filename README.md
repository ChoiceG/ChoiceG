# 👋🏽 Hi, I’m Choice – aka @ChoiceG

I’m a **Ruby on Rails developer** with a background in Chemistry, now building thoughtful, soulful apps that solve real-world problems and reflect purpose. My transition into tech wasn’t just a career shift — it was a calling. I’m passionate about building tools that connect people, preserve culture, and empower communities.
